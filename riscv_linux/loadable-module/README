This directory contains the source for the KUtrace loadable module, and its
Makefile. The make uses the kernel exported symbols on the compilation machine.
These need to include the exported KUtrace symbols from applying kernel patches.

For those  not building patches form scratch on a Raspberry Pi4-B, the pre-
compiled module for that fixed configuration is included here.

All the code is open sourced under GPL-2.0-or-later.
