This directory contains the source for the KUtrace loadable module, and its
Makefile. The make uses the kernel exported symbols on the compilation machine.
These need to include the exported KUtrace symbols from applying kernel patches.

All the code is open sourced under the BSD three-clause license, except the
loadable module and patches which is required by Linux to be licensed under
GPL.
